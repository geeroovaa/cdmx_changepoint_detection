Although by visual inspection there is no significant observable change it is hard to tell with such inconsistent data if there was any impact of the transit regulations on air quality. A model  fitting a polyfit curve that could take into account cyclicality would be a better approach to smoothen the data. Another way to go about would be to directly assess the air quality index in that region which is also available form the SEDEMA portal.Â
